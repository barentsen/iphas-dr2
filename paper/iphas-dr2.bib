abstract = {The INT/WFC Photometric H-alpha Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS) is an imaging survey being carried out in H-alpha, r' and i' filters, with the Wide Field Camera (WFC) on the 2.5-metre Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) to a depth of r'=20 (10 sigma). The survey is aimed at revealing large scale structure in our local galaxy, and also the properties of key early and late populations making up the Milky Way. Mapping emission line objects enables a particular focus on objects in the young and old stages of stellar evolution ranging from early T-Tauri stars to late planetary nebulae. In this paper we present the IPHAS Initial Data Release, primarily a photometric catalogue of about 200 million unique objects, coupled with associated image data covering about 1600 square degrees in three passbands. We note how access to the primary data products has been implemented through use of standard virtual observatory publishing interfaces. Simple traditional web access is provided to the main IPHAS photometric catalogue, in addition to a number of common catalogues (such as 2MASS) which are of immediate relevance. Access through the AstroGrid VO Desktop opens up the full range of analysis options, and allows full integration with the wider range of data and services available through the Virtual Observatory. The IDR represents the largest dataset published primarily through VO interfaces to date, and so stands as an examplar of the future of survey data mining. Examples of data access are given, including a cross-matching of IPHAS photometry with sources in the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey that validates the existing calibration of the best data.},

abstract = {We report on the discovery of over 50 strong H$\alpha$ emitting objects towards the large OB association Cyg OB2 and the HII region DR 15 on its southern periphery. This was achieved using the INT Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS), combined with follow-up spectroscopy using the MMT multi-object spectrometer HectoSpec. We present optical spectra, supplemented with optical r',i' and H$\alpha$ photometry from IPHAS, and near-infrared J,H and K photometry from Two Micron All Sky Survey. The position of the objects in the (J - H) versus (H - K) diagram strongly suggests most of them are young. Many show CaII infrared triplet emission indicating that they are in a pre-main-sequence phase of evolution of T Tauri and Herbig Ae nature. Among these, we have uncovered pronounced clustering of T Tauri stars roughly a degree south of the centre of Cyg OB2, in an arc close to the HII region DR 15, and the radio ring nebula G79.29+0.46, for which we discuss its candidacy as a luminous blue variable. The emission-line objects towards Cyg OB2 itself could be the brightest most prominent component of a population of lower mass pre-main-sequence stars that has yet to be uncovered. Finally, we discuss the nature of the ongoing star formation in Cyg OB2 and the possibility that the central OB stars have triggered star formation in the periphery.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm (\{$\backslash$scshape mead\}, for `Mapping Extinction Against Distance') which will determine intrinsic (\$r' - i'\$) colour, extinction, and distance for early-A to K4 stars extracted from the IPHAS \$r'/i'/\backslash Halpha\$ photometric database. These data can be binned up to map extinction in three dimensions across the northern Galactic Plane. The large size of the IPHAS database (\$\backslash sim 200\$ million unique objects), the accuracy of the digital photometry it contains and its faint limiting magnitude (\$r' \backslash sim 20\$) allow extinction to be mapped with fine angular (\$ \backslash sim 10 \$ arcmin) and distance (\$\backslash sim 0.1\$ \~{}kpc) resolution to distances of up to 10 kpc, outside the Solar Circle. High reddening within the Solar Circle on occasion brings this range down to \$\backslash sim 2\$ kpc. The resolution achieved, both in angle and depth, greatly exceeds that of previous empirical 3D extinction maps, enabling the structure of the Galactic Plane to be studied in increased detail. \{$\backslash$scshape mead\} accounts for the effect of the survey magnitude limits, photometric errors, unresolved ISM substructure, and binarity. The impact of metallicity variations, within the range typical of the Galactic disc is small. The accuracy and reliability of \{$\backslash$scshape mead\} are tested through the use of simulated photometry created with Monte-Carlo sampling techniques. The success of this algorithm is demonstrated on a selection of fields and the results are compared to the literature.},

abstract = {We present a catalogue of point-source H$\alpha$ emission-line objects selected from the INT/WFC Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (IPHAS) of the northern Galactic plane. The catalogue covers the magnitude range 13 <= r' <= 19.5 and includes Northern hemisphere sources in the Galactic latitude range -5° < b < 5°. It is derived from \~{}1500 deg2 worth of imaging data, which represents 80 per cent of the final IPHAS survey area. The electronic version of the catalogue will be updated once the full survey data become available. In total, the present catalogue contains 4853 point sources that exhibit strong photometric evidence for H$\alpha$ emission. We have so far analysed spectra for \~{}300 of these sources, confirming more than 95 per cent of them as genuine emission-line stars. A wide range of stellar populations are represented in the catalogue, including early-type emission-line stars, active late-type stars, interacting binaries, young stellar objects and compact nebulae. The spatial distribution of catalogue objects shows overdensities near sites of recent or current star formation, as well as possible evidence for the warp of the Galactic plane. Photometrically, the incidence of H$\alpha$ emission is bimodally distributed in (r' - i'). The blue peak is made up mostly of early-type emission-line stars, whereas the red peak may signal an increasing contribution from other objects, such as young/active low-mass stars. We have cross-matched our H$\alpha$-excess catalogue against the emission-line star catalogue of Kohoutek \& Wehmeyer, as well as against sources in SIMBAD. We find that fewer than 10 per cent of our sources can be matched to known objects of any type. Thus IPHAS is uncovering an order of magnitude more faint (r' > 13) emission-line objects than were previously known in the Milky Way.},

abstract = {Context: We have carried out a semi-automated search for planetary nebulae (PNe) in the INT photometric H-alpha survey (IPHAS) catalogue. We present the PN search and the list of selected candidates. We cross correlate the selected candidates with a number of existing infrared galactic surveys in order to gain further insight into the nature of the candidates. Spectroscopy of a subset of objects is used to estimate the number of PNe present in the entire candidate list. Aims: The overall aim of the IPHAS PN project is to carry out a deep census of PNe in the northern Galactic plane, an area where PN detections are clearly lacking. Methods: The PN search is carried out on the IPHAS photometric catalogue. The candidate selection is based on the IPHAS and 2MASS/UKIDSS colours of the objects and the final candidate selection is made visually. Results: From the original list of \~{}600 million IPHAS detections we have selected a total of 1005 objects. Of these, 224 are known objects, leaving us with 781 PN candidates. Based on the initial follow-up spectroscopy, we expect the list to include very young and proto-PNe in addition to genuine, normal PNe (\~{}16\%) and emission line objects other than PNe. We present additional criteria to select the most probable PN candidates from our candidate list.

@article{Nikolaev2000,
abstract = {We present results from the application of a global photometric calibration (GPC) procedure to calibration data from the first 2 years of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The GPC algorithm uses photometry of both primary standards and moderately bright ``tracer'' stars in 35 2MASS calibration fields. During the first 2 years of the survey, each standard was observed on approximately 50 nights, with about 900 individual measurements. Based on the photometry of primary standard stars and secondary tracer stars and under the assumption that the nightly zero-point drift is linear, the GPC ties together all calibration fields and all survey nights simultaneously, producing a globally optimized solution. Calibration solutions for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere observatories are found separately and are tested for global consistency based on common fields near the celestial equator. Several results from the GPC are presented, including establishing candidate secondary standards, monitoring of near-infrared atmospheric extinction coefficients, and verification of the global validity of the standards. The solution gives long-term averages of the atmospheric extinction coefficients (in magnitudes per air mass), AJ=0.096, AH=0.026, AKs=0.066 (north) and AJ=0.092, AH=0.031, AKs=0.065 (south), with formal error of 0.001. The residuals show small seasonal variations, most likely due to changing atmospheric content of water vapor. Extension of the GPC to \~{}100 field stars in each of the 35 calibration fields yields a catalog of more than 2000 photometric standards ranging from the 10th to 14th magnitude, with photometry that is globally consistent to \~{}1\%.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm to photometrically calibrate wide-field optical imaging surveys, which simultaneously solves for the calibration parameters and relative stellar fluxes using overlapping observations. The algorithm decouples the problem of ``relative'' calibrations from that of ``absolute'' calibrations; the absolute calibration is reduced to determining a few numbers for the entire survey. We pay special attention to the spatial structure of the calibration errors, allowing one to isolate particular error modes in downstream analyses. Applying this to the SDSS imaging data, we achieve \~{}1\% relative calibration errors across 8500 deg2 in griz; the errors are \~{}2\% for the u band. These errors are dominated by unmodeled atmospheric variations at Apache Point Observatory.

abstract = {Context: The study of symbiotic stars is essential to understand important aspects of stellar evolution in interacting binaries. Their observed population in the Galaxy is however poorly known, and is one to three orders of magnitudes smaller than the predicted population size. Aims: IPHAS, the INT Photometric H$\alpha$ survey of the Northern Galactic plane, gives us the opportunity to make a systematic, complete search for symbiotic stars in a magnitude-limited volume, and discover a significant number of new systems. Methods: A method of selecting candidate symbiotic stars by combining IPHAS and near-IR (2MASS) colours is presented. It allows us to distinguish symbiotic binaries from normal stars and most of the other types of H$\alpha$ emission line stars in the Galaxy. The only exception are T Tauri stars, which can however be recognized because of their concentration in star forming regions. Results: Using these selection criteria, we discuss the classification of a list of 4338 IPHAS stars with H$\alpha$ in emission. 1500 to 2000 of them are likely to be Be stars. Among the remaining objects, 1183 fulfill our photometric constraints to be considered candidate symbiotic stars. The spectroscopic confirmation of three of these objects, which are the first new symbiotic stars discovered by IPHAS, proves the potential of the survey and selection method.

Methods: The planetary nebula was discovered from the IPHAS survey. Long-slit follow-up spectroscopy was carried out to confirm its planetary nebula nature and to calculate its physical and chemical characteristics. Results: The newly discovered planetary nebula turned out to be located at a very large galactocentric distance (DGC = 20.8 ± 3.8 kpc), larger than any previously known planetary nebula with measured abundances. Its relatively high oxygen abundance (12+log(O/H) = 8.36 ± 0.03) supports a flattening of the Galactic abundance gradient at large galactocentric distances rather than a linearly decreasing gradient.},

Follow-up spectroscopy enables confirmation of the PNe, and their physico-chemical study. Results: .The first planetary nebula discovered via IPHAS imagery shows an intricate morphology: there is an inner ring surrounding the central star, bright inner lobes with an enhanced waist, and very faint lobular extensions reaching up to more than 100''. We classify it as a quadrupolar PN, a rather unusual class of planetary showing two pairs of misaligned lobes. From long-slit spectroscopy we derive T\_e[ Nii] =12 800±1000 K, Ne = 390±40 cm-3, and chemical abundances typical of Peimbert's type I nebulae (He/H =0.13, N/O =1.8) with an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)=8.17±0.15. A kinematic distance of 7.0+4.5-3.0 kpc is derived, implying an unusually large size of \&gt;4 pc for the nebula. The photometry of the central star indicates the presence of a relatively cool companion. This, and the evidence for a dense circumstellar disk and quadrupolar morphology, all of which are rare among PNe, support the hypothesis that this morphology is related to binary interaction.},

@article{Corradi2010,
abstract = {Context. Knowledge of the total population of symbiotic stars in the Galaxy is important for understanding basic aspects of stellar evolution in interacting binaries and the relevance of this class of objects in the formation of supernovae of type Ia. Aims: In a previous paper, we presented the selection criteria needed to search for symbiotic stars in IPHAS, the INT H$\alpha$ survey of the Northern Galactic plane. IPHAS gives us the opportunity to make a systematic, complete search for symbiotic stars in a magnitude-limited volume. Methods: Follow-up spectroscopy at different telescopes worldwide of a sample of sixty two symbiotic star candidates is presented. Results: Seven out of nineteen S-type candidates observed spectroscopically are confirmed to be genuine symbiotic stars. The spectral type of their red giant components, as well as reddening and distance, were computed by modelling the spectra. Only one new D-type symbiotic system, out of forty-three candidates observed, was found. This was as expected (see discussion in our paper on the selection criteria). The object shows evidence for a high density outflow expanding at a speed ≥65 km s-1. Most of the other candidates are lightly reddened classical T Tauri stars and more highly reddened young stellar objects that may be either more massive young stars of HAeBe type or classical Be stars. In addition, a few notable objects have been found, such as three new Wolf-Rayet stars and two relatively high-luminosity evolved massive stars. We also found a helium-rich source, possibly a dense ejecta hiding a WR star, which is surrounded by a large ionized nebula. Conclusions: These spectroscopic data allow us to refine the selection criteria for symbiotic stars in the IPHAS survey and, more generally, to better understand the behaviour of different H$\alpha$ emitters in the IPHAS and 2MASS colour-colour diagrams. Based on observations obtained at; the 2.6 m Nordic Optical Telescope operated by NOTSA; the 2.5 m INT and 4.2 m WHT telescopes of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrof\'{\i}sica de Canarias; the 2.3 m ANU telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia; the Asiago 1.82 m telescope of the INAF Astronomical Observatory of Padova, Italy; and the 2.1 m telescope at San Pedro Martir, Mexico.

The survey is a high galactic latitude, blank- field sample to a 5$\sigma$ limit of K \~{} 17.3. The methods for constructing the infrared survey are described, including flat-fielding, astrometry, mosaicking and photometry. Also described are optical CCD observations which cover the survey to provide optical-infrared colours of almost all the objects in the sample. Star-galaxy discrimination is performed, and the results are used to derive the infrared star and galaxy counts. K-band `no-evolution' galaxy-count models are constructed and compared with the observational data. In the infrared, there is no counterpart for the large excess of faint galaxies over the no-evolution model seen in optical counts. In contrast, the K counts require little or no evolution in the luminosity or space density of galaxies, although it is shown that the count predictions can be remarkably insensitive to evolution under certain reasonable assumptions. Finally, model predictions for K-selected redshift surveys are derived.},

abstract = {The Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Photometric H-Alpha Survey (IPHAS) is a 1800 deg2 survey of the Northern Galactic Plane, reaching down to r'˜ 21. We demonstrate how the survey can be used to (1) reliably select classical T Tauri star candidates and (2) constrain the mass accretion rates with an estimated relative uncertainty of 0.6 dex. IPHAS is a necessary addition to spectroscopic surveys because it allows large and uniform samples of accretion rates to be obtained with a precise handle on the selection effects. We apply the method on a region of 7 deg2 towards the H II region IC 1396 in Cepheus OB2 and identify 158 pre-main-sequence candidates with masses between 0.2 and 2.0 Msun and accretion rates between 10-9.2 and 10-7.0 Msun yr-1. We find a power-law dependency between the stellar mass and the accretion rates with a slope of $\alpha$= 1.1 ± 0.2, which is less steep than indicated by previous studies. We discuss the influence of method-dependent systematic effects on the determination of this relationship. The majority of our sample consists of faint, previously unknown, low-mass T Tauri candidates (56 per cent between 0.2 and 0.5 Msun). Many candidates are clustered in front of three bright-rimmed molecular clouds, which are being ionized by the massive star HD 206267 (O6.5V). We discover a spatio-temporal gradient of increasing accretion rates, increasing Spitzer infrared excess, and younger ages away from the ionizing star, providing a strong indication that the formation of these clusters has been sequentially triggered by HD 206267 during the last ˜1 Myr.},

The availability of new photometric surveys such as IPHAS (the INT/WFC photometric H$\alpha$ survey of the northern Galactic plane) covering large portions of the sky provide an opportunity to apply the so-called extinction method to determine the distances of a large number of objects. Methods: The technique is applied to a sample of 137 PNe located between -5 and 5 degrees in Galactic latitude, and between 29.52 and 215.49 degrees in longitude. The characteristics of the distance-extinction method and the main sources of errors are carefully discussed. Results: The data on the extinction of the PNe available in the literature, complemented by new observations, allow us to determine extinction distances for 70 PNe. A comparison with statistical distance scales from different authors is presented.},
